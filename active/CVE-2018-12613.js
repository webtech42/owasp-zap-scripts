var TITLE = "[CVE-2018-12613] PhpMyAdmin 4.8.1 Remote File Inclusion"
var DESCRIPTION = "An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin 4.8.x before 4.8.2, in which an attacker can include (view and potentially execute) files on the server. The vulnerability comes from a portion of code where pages are redirected and loaded within phpMyAdmin, and an improper test for whitelisted pages. An attacker must be authenticated, except in the \"$cfg['AllowArbitraryServer'] = true\" case (where an attacker can specify any host he/she is already in control of, and execute arbitrary code on phpMyAdmin) and the \"$cfg['ServerDefault'] = 0\" case (which bypasses the login requirement and runs the vulnerable code without any authentication)."
var SOLUTION = "Apply all relevant security patches and product upgrades."
var REFERENCE = "https://github.com/vulhub/vulhub/tree/master/phpmyadmin/CVE-2018-12613"
var OTHER = "see: https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-12613"
