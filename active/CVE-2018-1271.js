var TITLE = "[CVE-2018-1271] Spring MVC Directory Traversal Vulnerability"
var DESCRIPTION = "Spring Framework, versions 5.0 prior to 5.0.5 and versions 4.3 prior to 4.3.15 and older unsupported versions, allow applications to configure Spring MVC to serve static resources (e.g. CSS, JS, images). When static resources are served from a file system on Windows (as opposed to the classpath, or the ServletContext), a malicious user can send a request using a specially crafted URL that can lead a directory traversal attack."
var SOLUTION = "Apply all relevant security patches and product upgrades."
var REFERENCE = "https://medium.com/@knownsec404team/analysis-of-spring-mvc-directory-traversal-vulnerability-cve-2018-1271-b291bdb6be0d"
