var TITLE = "[CVE-2019-10092] Apache mod_proxy HTML Injection / Partial XSS"
var DESCRIPTION = "In Apache HTTP Server 2.4.0-2.4.39, a limited cross-site scripting issue was reported affecting the mod_proxy error page. An attacker could cause the link on the error page to be malformed and instead point to a page of their choice. This would only be exploitable where a server was set up with proxying enabled but was misconfigured in such a way that the Proxy Error page was displayed."
var SOLUTION = "Apply all relevant security patches and product upgrades."
var REFERENCE = "https://github.com/DrunkenShells/Disclosures/tree/master/CVE-2019-10092-Limited%20Cross-Site%20Scripting%20in%20mod_proxy%20Error%20Page-Apache%20httpd"
