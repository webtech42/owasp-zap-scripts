var TITLE = "[CVE-2020-5284] Next.js .next/ limited path traversal"
var DESCRIPTION = "Next.js versions before 9.3.2 have a directory traversal vulnerability. Attackers could craft special requests to access files in the dist directory (.next). This does not affect files outside of the dist directory (.next). In general, the dist directory only holds build assets unless your application intentionally stores other assets under this directory. This issue is fixed in version 9.3.2."
var SOLUTION = "Apply all relevant security patches and product upgrades."
var REFERENCE = "https://github.com/zeit/next.js/releases/tag/v9.3.2 https://github.com/zeit/next.js/security/advisories/GHSA-fq77-7p7r-83rj"
var OTHER = "see: https://github.com/zeit/next.js/releases/tag/v9.3.2"
