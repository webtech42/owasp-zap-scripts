Sequence scripts
================

Scripts which define sequences of requests that should perform a specific task in an application.
Sequence scripts must be implemented in Zest, and are used by the optional [Sequence Scanner](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/desktop/addons/sequence-scanner/) add-on that is available from the ZAP Marketplace.
